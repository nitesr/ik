# Online Median
#   Given a list of numbers, the task is to insert these numbers into a stream 
#       and find the median of the stream after each insertion. If the median is a non-integer, consider itâ€™s floor value.
#   The median of a sorted array is defined as the middle element when the number of elements is odd 
#       and the mean of the middle two elements when the number of elements is even.
#
# Example 1:
#   Input: stream = [3, 8, 5, 2]
#   Output: [3, 5, 5, 4]
#   Explanation:
#       Iteration 1 -> [3] -> sort -> [3] -> 3 (median)
#       Iteration 2 -> [3, 8] -> sort -> [3, 8] -> 5 (median)
#       Iteration 3 -> [3, 8, 5] -> sort -> [3, 5, 8] -> 5 (median)
#       Iteration 4 -> [3, 8, 5, 2] -> sort -> [2, 3, 5, 8] -> 4 (median)
#
#
# Constraints:
#   1 <= length of stream <= 10^5
#   1 <= any value in the stream <= 10^5
#   The stream can contain duplicates.
